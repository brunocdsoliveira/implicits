\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper has presented $\ourlang$, the Calculus Of CoHerent ImplicitS, a new
calculus for implicit programming that improves upon the implicit calculus and
strikes a good balance between flexibility and coherence. In particular,
$\ourlang$ supports local scoping, overlapping instances, first-class
instances, and higher-order rules, while remaining type safe, coherent and
unambiguous.

In future work it would be interesting to integrate Genus's solution for the
global coherence problem~\cite{Zhang15LFO}.

%%We present a formal type system for the calculus and provide semantics via a
%%translation to System F. We prove that the translation preserves types and thus
%%establish type soundness for $\ourlang$.

%%The calculus provides a formal platform for the development of
%%a realistic source language. Our small source language already shows 
%%how to add implicit instantiation on top of the calculus. In further
%%work we intend to develop this into a full-fledged language.

% the literature: how to support coherence for overlapping rules in
% nested scoping; and how to support resolution with higher-order

%Future work includes the design of a source language with a powerful 
%modularity construct (which could be a form of modules, OO classes 
%or records with associated types) to model ``type-class'' style
%interfaces. Type inference and additional source-level constructs on top of
%$\ourlang$ also deserve further attention.
