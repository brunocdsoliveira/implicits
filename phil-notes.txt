Notes on The Implicit Calculus

Throughout: Please use author-name citations rather than numeric;
            see ICFP call for papers.

p10.2--3   Instead, perhaps say we use Barendregt convention?
        It implies the condition given here.

p10.34  Give a citation for Curry-Howard, possibly my CACM Dec 2015 paper.
        By the way, I've taken to calling Curry-Howard "Propositions as Types"
        (because the name Curry-Howard annoys those who think credit should
        go to Brouwer, Heyting, Kolmogorov, or De Bruijn), might want to
        make that change here.

p10.38  Instead of writing |- with a dot over it in Fig 3, why don't we write
        |-^a_r in Fig 3 (the a is for ambiguous) and leave out the dots in Fig 4?
        Fig 4 is the more complex, so better if it uses simpler symbols.

p11.8   (WF-AbsTy) should be (WF-UnivTy) or the like.  Type abstraction is a term form,
        yielding a term of universal type.

p11.31  Perhaps we should replace \epsilon |-_unamb \rho by |-_unamb \rho
        (a judgment with only a conclusion) and then add the definition

          \epsilon |-_unamb \rho
          ----------------------
             |-_unamb \rho

        to the definition of |-_unamb.  (By the way, that definition should be
        in a separate figure.)

p11.24  If we follow the Barendregt convention (see p10.2--3), 
        then we don't need the second hypothesis of (Ty-TAbs).

p12.1   I find it immensely confusing that the (R-) prefix is used to name rules
        both in Fig 3 and Fig 4. Can the prefix for one or the other be changed please?
        Currently, (R-IAbs) appears in both Fig 3 and Fig 4 with different definitions!

p12.23  Why is this section written in outline form? It makes it hard to read.
        It should be fine written as an ordinary narrative without bullet points.

p12.24  Either explain focussing in more detail here, or explain all the proof
        rules first and then mention at the end that they happen to correspond
        to focussing.

p12.26--32  I cannot follow what you are saying here.  I don't know what you mean
        by "pivot on an environment lookup" or "shifts the focus" or "backward
        chaining" or "forward chaining".  The rule references were too compact
        to help, and it took me a while to realise that you meant rules in Fig 3
        rather than Fig 4.  Giving explicit correspondences between rules in Fig 3
        and rules in Fig 4 would help. Currently you mention rules in Fig 3 and
        ask the reader to guess what they correspond to in Fig 4.

p12.32  "introduction rules in inverted form" Can you explain this at greater
        length please? I wasn't sure what it meant.

p12.42--47  I think this might be easier to read if you give the example first
         (be clearer on how "the outer context is instantiated").  Possibly
         just give the two derivations with the ambiguous resolution rules,
         as you did on p11.43--48.

p13.1   "To implement measures (1) and (3b)" Drop the bullet points, and drop
        this phrase, to begin "We provid a variant ..."  The reader will be
        adequately motivated by the previous discussion, tracing the choice of
        syntax to specific parts of it is probably counterproductive.

p13.5   Can we get rid of blue \sigma now please?  Just typeset \sigma in black.

p13.10  "convenient for measure (1)" -->
        "convenient to make our definition syntax directed"

p13.11  "help us to implement measure (3b)" -->
        "help us to avoid ambiguous instantiations"

p13.13  We need to explain how the judgments in Fig 3 and Fig 4 relate, e.g.
        \Gamma |-^a_r \rho  iff  \Gamma |-^a_r \rho.
        (The relation changes when we add E.)
        As I recall, we had ways to relate the auxiliary judgements in Fig 4
        to Fig 3 as well, and it would be good to make those relations
        explicit.

p13.14  You've explained that \bar{\alpha} is just the sequence of type variables
        in \Gamma. But you haven't explained what it is there for! Why do we need it?
        I think you added it after my day with Bruno, so I have no idea why it is there,
        and I cannot work it out by looking at the rules

p13.24,25.  References to "(measure (1))" and "(measure (2))" can be dropped,
        similarly for later references. If its an important concept, best to give it
        a name (such as "syntax-directed judgment") rather than a number in a
        bulleted list.

p13.26  "Third auxiliary judgement" Somewhere around here you need to refer
        to the definition of \Sigma, so the reader knows what it means when it
        is encountered in the text.

p13.38  "after the rule has been committed to" I have no idea what this means.
        Also, the grammar of this sentence is convoluted or wrong. Did you want
        a comma after "to"? In any event, best to rewrite.

p13.43  Around here should say something like:
        "Judgment \bar{\alpha} |-_unamb \rho holds when a solution
        to \tau[\bar{\sigma}/\bar{\alpha}] = \tau', where \tau is the
        head of \rho, uniquely specifies each type in \bar{sigma}."
        (Did I get that right?)

p14.43  In hypothesis of (M-TApp), \Sigma should not be in gray.

p15.7   Move the footnote into the text. In general, move *all* footnotes into
        the text.  Forcing the reader to look to the bottom of the page and then
        re-find their place in the main text does not enhance readability!

p15.14--20  Move the definition into its own figure.  Also see note for p11.31.

p15.24  "recursively requires that these contexts are unambiguous"
        Why is it appropriate to use \epsilon rather than \bar{\alpha} to the
        left of the turnstyle?  Note the question sort of answers itself if
        we adopt the suggestion from the note for p11.31.

                          |-_unamb \rho is the judgment that \rho is unambiguous
             \bar{\alpha} |-_unamb \rho is the judgment that all type variables in
                             \bar{\alpha} are resolved by matching against \rho

p15.25--26  Delete. Dealt with earlier.

p15.29  "stable under all possible substitutions \Theta"  
        You need to first define what "stable" means and explain why stability is
        important.

p15.40--43  At last, an explanation of \bar{\alpha}. Please include a forward
        reference to this explanation when \bar{\alpha} is first introduced.

p16.14--10  Put definition of |-_coh in its own figure (or in Fig 6).

p16.23--30  Probably clearer to avoid a bulleted list.

p16.26  "that substitutes \bar{\alpha}" -->
        "where the domain of \Theta is restricted to \bar{\alpha}"

p16.27  Add "If no unifier exists, then rule (COH-simp) does not apply."

p16.32  Need to draw attention when the judgment is first mentioned that
        it mentions both \Sigma and \Sigma', I missed this and got confused
        reading the rest of the paragraph.

p16.42  Shouldn't this definition come when mgu is first mentioned?

p16.43  "Moreover, \Theta subsumes any other such unifier" Perhaps write out
        in full what this means.

p16.43  "The algorithm itself is fairly straightforward" Presumably the
        figure simply repeats a standard algorithm from the literature?
        Why not say so, and give a citation to the original?

p17.32  Reading the rules for this judgment, I found it hard to spot the
        delimiting semicolons. Possibly better to use something more visible,
        such as a horizontal rule |, in which case replace ; by | uniformly
        in all judgments.

p18.32  "The source of this non-termination are" Non-agreement of subject with verb!

p18.33  "first two auxiliary judgments" In which figure? But couldn't you also get
        a loop using the definition in Fig 3, which has no auxiliary judgments?
        I'm wondering if there is a simpler explanation of the source of non-termination.

p18.42--47  Is this new work, or is this just copied from Haskell [16]?
        If the former, I found the phrase "One potential problem ..." misleading.
        There are no potential problems, since the Haskell guys have solved them
        for us!

p19.27--29  Maybe we should add the termination conditions to the well-formedness
        of types, with a pointer to this section.
