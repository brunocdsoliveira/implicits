> p10.2--3   Instead, perhaps say we use Barendregt convention?
>         It implies the condition given here.

DONE
 
> p10.34  Give a citation for Curry-Howard, possibly my CACM Dec 2015 paper.
>         By the way, I've taken to calling Curry-Howard "Propositions as Types"
>         (because the name Curry-Howard annoys those who think credit should

>         make that change here.

DONE
 
> p10.38  Instead of writing |- with a dot over it in Fig 3, why don't we write
>         |-^a_r in Fig 3 (the a is for ambiguous) and leave out the dots in Fig 4?
>         Fig 4 is the more complex, so better if it uses simpler symbols.
 
DONE

> p11.8   (WF-AbsTy) should be (WF-UnivTy) or the like.  Type abstraction is a term form,
>         yielding a term of universal type.

DONE
 
> p11.31  Perhaps we should replace \epsilon |-_unamb \rho by |-_unamb \rho

DONE

DONE

> p11.24  If we follow the Barendregt convention (see p10.2--3), 
>         then we don't need the second hypothesis of (Ty-TAbs).

DONE
 
> p12.1   I find it immensely confusing that the (R-) prefix is used to name rules
>         both in Fig 3 and Fig 4. Can the prefix for one or the other be changed please?
>         Currently, (R-IAbs) appears in both Fig 3 and Fig 4 with different definitions!

DONE
TODO: propagate this change throughout section 3
 
> p12.23  Why is this section written in outline form? It makes it hard to read.
>         It should be fine written as an ordinary narrative without bullet points.

TODO
 
> p12.24  Either explain focussing in more detail here, or explain all the proof
>         rules first and then mention at the end that they happen to correspond
>         to focussing.

TODO
 
> p12.26--32  I cannot follow what you are saying here.  I don't know what you mean
>         by "pivot on an environment lookup" or "shifts the focus" or "backward
>         chaining" or "forward chaining".  The rule references were too compact
>         to help, and it took me a while to realise that you meant rules in Fig 3
>         rather than Fig 4.  Giving explicit correspondences between rules in Fig 3
>         and rules in Fig 4 would help. Currently you mention rules in Fig 3 and
>         ask the reader to guess what they correspond to in Fig 4.

TODO
 
> p12.32  "introduction rules in inverted form" Can you explain this at greater
>         length please? I wasn't sure what it meant.

TODO
 
> p12.42--47  I think this might be easier to read if you give the example first
>          (be clearer on how "the outer context is instantiated").  Possibly
>          just give the two derivations with the ambiguous resolution rules,
>          as you did on p11.43--48.

TODO
 
> p13.1   "To implement measures (1) and (3b)" Drop the bullet points, and drop
>         this phrase, to begin "We provid a variant ..."  The reader will be
>         adequately motivated by the previous discussion, tracing the choice of
>         syntax to specific parts of it is probably counterproductive.

TODO
 
> p13.5   Can we get rid of blue \sigma now please?  Just typeset \sigma in black.

DONE 

> p13.10  "convenient for measure (1)" -->
>         "convenient to make our definition syntax directed"

TODO
 
> p13.11  "help us to implement measure (3b)" -->
>         "help us to avoid ambiguous instantiations"

TODO
 
> p13.13  We need to explain how the judgments in Fig 3 and Fig 4 relate, e.g.
>         \Gamma |-^a_r \rho  iff  \Gamma |-^a_r \rho.
>         (The relation changes when we add E.)
>         As I recall, we had ways to relate the auxiliary judgements in Fig 4
>         to Fig 3 as well, and it would be good to make those relations
>         explicit.

TODO
 
> p13.14  You've explained that \bar{\alpha} is just the sequence of type variables
>         in \Gamma. But you haven't explained what it is there for! Why do we need it?
>         I think you added it after my day with Bruno, so I have no idea why it is there,
>         and I cannot work it out by looking at the rules
 
TODO

> p13.24,25.  References to "(measure (1))" and "(measure (2))" can be dropped,
>         similarly for later references. If its an important concept, best to give it
>         a name (such as "syntax-directed judgment") rather than a number in a
>         bulleted list.

TODO
 
> p13.26  "Third auxiliary judgement" Somewhere around here you need to refer
>         to the definition of \Sigma, so the reader knows what it means when it
>         is encountered in the text.


TODO 

> p13.38  "after the rule has been committed to" I have no idea what this means.
>         Also, the grammar of this sentence is convoluted or wrong. Did you want
>         a comma after "to"? In any event, best to rewrite.

TODO
 
> p13.43  Around here should say something like:
>         "Judgment \bar{\alpha} |-_unamb \rho holds when a solution
>         to \tau[\bar{\sigma}/\bar{\alpha}] = \tau', where \tau is the
>         head of \rho, uniquely specifies each type in \bar{sigma}."
>         (Did I get that right?)

TODO
 
> p14.43  In hypothesis of (M-TApp), \Sigma should not be in gray.

DONE
 
> p15.7   Move the footnote into the text. In general, move *all* footnotes into
>         the text.  Forcing the reader to look to the bottom of the page and then
>         re-find their place in the main text does not enhance readability!
 
DONE

> p15.14--20  Move the definition into its own figure.  Also see note for p11.31.

DONE
 
> p15.24  "recursively requires that these contexts are unambiguous"
>         Why is it appropriate to use \epsilon rather than \bar{\alpha} to the
>         left of the turnstyle?  Note the question sort of answers itself if
>         we adopt the suggestion from the note for p11.31.
> 
>                           |-_unamb \rho is the judgment that \rho is unambiguous
>              \bar{\alpha} |-_unamb \rho is the judgment that all type variables in
>                              \bar{\alpha} are resolved by matching against \rho

DONE?
 
> p15.25--26  Delete. Dealt with earlier.

TODO?
 
> p15.29  "stable under all possible substitutions \Theta"  
>         You need to first define what "stable" means and explain why stability is
>         important.

TODO
 
> p15.40--43  At last, an explanation of \bar{\alpha}. Please include a forward
>         reference to this explanation when \bar{\alpha} is first introduced.

TODO
 
> p16.14--10  Put definition of |-_coh in its own figure (or in Fig 6).

DONE
 
> p16.23--30  Probably clearer to avoid a bulleted list.

DONE
 
> p16.26  "that substitutes \bar{\alpha}" -->
>         "where the domain of \Theta is restricted to \bar{\alpha}"

DONE
 
> p16.27  Add "If no unifier exists, then rule (COH-simp) does not apply."

DONE
 
> p16.32  Need to draw attention when the judgment is first mentioned that
>         it mentions both \Sigma and \Sigma', I missed this and got confused
>         reading the rest of the paragraph.

TODO
 
> p16.42  Shouldn't this definition come when mgu is first mentioned?

DONE
 
> p16.43  "Moreover, \Theta subsumes any other such unifier" Perhaps write out
>         in full what this means.
 
DONE

> p16.43  "The algorithm itself is fairly straightforward" Presumably the

>         Why not say so, and give a citation to the original?

TODO
 
> p17.32  Reading the rules for this judgment, I found it hard to spot the

TODO
 
> p18.32  "The source of this non-termination are" Non-agreement of subject with verb!

DONE
 
> p18.33  "first two auxiliary judgments" In which figure? But couldn't you also get
>         a loop using the definition in Fig 3, which has no auxiliary judgments?
>         I'm wondering if there is a simpler explanation of the source of non-termination.

DONE
 
> p18.42--47  Is this new work, or is this just copied from Haskell [16]?
>         If the former, I found the phrase "One potential problem ..." misleading.
>         There are no potential problems, since the Haskell guys have solved them
>         for us!

DONE

> p19.27--29  Maybe we should add the termination conditions to the well-formedness

1. INTRODUCTION

p1.1  "Flexibility vs ease of reasoning" I agree that coherence increases ease
      of reasoning. But I'm not sure that anyone looking at our Figure 4 will
      say our system makes reasoning easy. Can we address this in any way?

p2.22 Add to the long list of work on limitations of type classes: chain
      (Morris and Jones, ICFP 2010).

p2.31 Ought to say a bit more about the strengths of the implicit calcululus,
      and that it is the basis for our work.

p2.41 Add a footnote: "Cochise, 1804--1874, was chief of the Chokonen band of
      the Chiricahua Apache." (Alas, this suggest a non-existent application of
      our work to the Apache web server; the name doesn't really seem to fit.)

p3.7  This mention of focus will leave the reader at a disadvantage if they don't
      know what focussing is.  Needs to be rephrased.  Something like this.
      "We introduce a logical formulation of how to resolve implicits,
      which is simple but ambiguous and incoherent, and a second formulation,
      which is less simple but unambiguous and coherent.  Every resolution
      of the second formulation is also a resolution of the first, but not
      conversely.  Parts of the second formulation bear a close resemblance
      to a standard technique for proof search in logic called \emph{focussing}
      [citations come here]."

p3.14--16  Yes, it would be good to do this. But the present paper does
      not draw out the connection that strongly. Further, there are a lot
      of differences between what we do and focussed proof search.

p3.18 We should submit the full proofs as a supplement with the paper,
      I believe ICFP supports this. Double-blinded conferences frown on
      including links to the author's web page in the submission, for
      obvious reasons.

p3.19 Should we say something about this paper giving a neater formulation
      of the implicit calcululus? The reason I got into all this was to
      provide a neat, binary formulation of your somewhat awkward n-ary
      rules.
