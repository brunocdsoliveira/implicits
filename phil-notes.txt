Notes on The Implicit Calculus

p<page>.<line>

p10.2--3   Instead, perhaps say we use Barendregt convention?
        It implies the condition given here.

p10.34  Give a citation for Curry-Howard, possibly my CACM Dec 2015 paper.
        By the way, I've taken to calling Curry-Howard "Propositions as Types"
        (because the name Curry-Howard annoys those who think credit should
        go to Brouwer, Heyting, Kolmogorov, or De Bruijn), might want to
        make that change here.

p10.38  Instead of writing |- with a dot over it in Fig 3, why don't we write
        |-^a_r in Fig 2 (the a is for ambiguous) and leave out the dots in Fig 3.
        Fig 3 is the more complex, so better if it uses simpler symbols.

p10.44  I mistakenly read (Int, Bool, Bool => Int) as ((Int, Bool, Bool) => Int) rather
        than (Int, Bool, (Bool => Int)).  Possible fixes:
          (a) put additional space after each comma, and less around =>.
          (b) put parens around (Bool => Int) wherever it appears.
        I prefer (b). Might also introduce
           \Gamma_0 = (Int, Bool, (Int => Bool)) 
        which may make the two derivations easier to read (and they might be put side-by-side).

p11.8   (WF-AbsTy) should be (WF-UnivTy) or the like.  Type abstraction is a term form,
        yielding a term of universal type.

p11.24  If we follow the Barendregt convention (see p10.2--3), 
        then we don't need the second hypothesis of (Ty-TAbs).




p10.43  (UA-IAbs) should be (UA-IApp).

p11--12, Fig 2--3. 
        
p11.38  "To solve the two problems" Delete, the two problems were mentioned too far back.
        Rest of the sentence will be clear, regardless.  Or, move this sentence to the
        beginning of 3.4, and then introduce the types and judgments.

p11.38--p13.13  The discussion is out of date and does not match the figure

p11.38--p13.13  There is no explanation of \sigma types. Yes, lets call them monotypes.

p12.46  In hypothesis of (M-TAbs), \Sigma should not be in gray.

p12     We need to explain how the judgments in Fig 2 and Fig 3 relate, e.g.
        \Gamma |-^a_r \rho  iff  \Gamma |-^a_r \rho.
        (The relation changes when we add E.)
        
        Can't we get rid of \bar{\alpha} in the second and third judgement?
        It is just tyvars(\Gamma), and \Gamma stays unchanged in the second
        and third judgment.

        The two hypotheses of (L-RuleMatch) can be typeset side-by-side, which
        will save space (figure is currently too long).

        The first hypothesis of (L-RuleNoMatch) can be changed to something
        like 


p13.23  "in rule (Ty-IAbs) of Figure 1" -->
        "in rules (Ty-IAbs) and (Ty-Query) of Figure 1"
        and then delete p13.29--30.

p13.24  "The defininition of \bar{\alpha} |-_unamb"  --> 
        "The defininition of \bar{\alpha} |-_unamb \rho"

p13.25--28  The reader needs a more general guide. Something like: "Judgment
        \bar{\alpha} |-_unamb \rho holds when a solution to the matching
        problem, \rho[\bar{\rho'}/\bar{\alpha}] = \rho'', uniquely specifies
        each type in \bar{\rho'}."

        The explanation needs to explain why in (UA-IAbs) the first hypothesis
        take an empty sequence of type variables.

        I really don't follow either of these sentences, I think they need to
        be completely rewritten.  First is to decide whether we want 
        (UA-TAbs) and (UA-IAbs) or (UA-TAbsAlt) and (UA-IAbsAlt)!

p13.45--47  Move the two footnotes into the text as parenthetic notes. In general,
        move *all* footnotes into the text.  Forcing the reader to look to the bottom
        of the page and then re-find their place in the main text does not help
        readability.
